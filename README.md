# House-Price-prediction

Predict house prices using a simple linear regression workflow built in a Jupyter notebook.

## Overview
This project explores and models the `Housing.csv` dataset to predict `price`.
It follows these steps in `house-Price.ipynb`:
- Load data and inspect shape/columns
- Exploratory Data Analysis (missing values, basic distributions, outliers)
- Encode categorical features and map binary yes/no to 1/0
- Distribution and skewness checks; apply log transform with `np.log1p` to `area` and `price`
- Train/test split and Linear Regression modeling
- Evaluation and visualization of predictions

## Dataset
- File: `Housing.csv`
- Target: `price`
- Example features used:
  - Numeric: `area`
  - Categorical: `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `parking`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`

## EDA Highlights
- No missing values were found via `df.isnull().sum()`.
- Train/test shapes before cleaning: `(436, 15)` and `(109, 15)`.
- Outliers (IQR method) observed notably in `area` and `price`:
  - Train: `area`=11, `price`=12
  - Test: `area`=1, `price`=2
- Skewness (after outlier removal, before power transform):
  - `area` train: ~0.80; test: ~0.44
  - `price` train: ~0.76; test: ~0.64

## Preprocessing
- One-hot encoding for `furnishingstatus` with first category dropped (avoids dummy trap).
- Binary columns (`mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `prefarea`) mapped using `{'yes': 1, 'no': 0}`.
- Log transform applied to `area` and `price` via `np.log1p` to reduce skew.
## Modeling
- Model: `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`
- Split: `train_test_split(test_size=0.2, random_state=42)`

## Results
- Performance (evaluated on log-transformed scale):
  - Train R²: 0.7154, Adjusted R²: 0.7066, MAE: 0.1448
  - Test R²: 0.6782, Adjusted R²: 0.6342, MAE: 0.1998
- Scatter plot of Actual vs Predicted shows moderate fit with dispersion around the diagonal.

## How to Run

### Notebook
1. Ensure dependencies are installed (see `requirements.txt`).
2. Open `house-Price.ipynb` in Jupyter (e.g., `jupyter notebook`).
3. Ensure `Housing.csv` is in the same directory.
4. Run cells top to bottom.

### Streamlit App
1. Ensure `housing_price_model.pkl` exists in the project root (generated by the notebook).
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app:
   
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
4. Open the provided local URL in your browser and enter house details to get a prediction.

## Notes
- Evaluation metrics are computed on log-transformed targets (`np.log1p`). To view metrics in the original price scale, inverse-transform with `np.expm1` before evaluation.
